# Membership

This repository contains the membership addons with modifications for PolyFab.
Right now, it only adds qualifications for each member.
Here are some features that would be interesting to add:

* [ ] Member should have qualifications for a set of machines.
      A qualification expires after a certain amount of time. After expiration, a new qualification for the member can be created and appears as a new line in the list of qualifications.
* [x] Membership product should be generics.
      An administrator would not need to create a membership product for each time a member buys a membership.
      Only the duration and the cost of the membership product should be specified.
      The validation of the membership for the user would be computed on the fly.
* [ ] Member should be able to check in.
      Each time a member checks in, we could show the status of his membership and his qualifications, and a list of machines he can use.
* [ ] Administrator should be able to see an history of the all the check-ins.
